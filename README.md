# MySQL Workbench Basics

Welcome! I am excited to share with you the insights I have gained from the ITFactory course through this MySQL-Database repository. Inside, you will find a comprehensive showcase of fundamental database management skills using MySQL Workbench.

## Project Highlights

- **Database Setup:** Created a database named "cinema" and established key tables such as `cartoons`, `sci_fi_films`, `action_films`, `horror`, and `love`.

- **Data Management:** Populated tables with sample data using `INSERT` statements and updated records using the `UPDATE` statement.

- **Data Retrieval:** Developed proficiency in retrieving data with `SELECT` queries, implementing filtering through `WHERE` clauses, limiting results using `LIMIT`, and utilizing aliases with `AS`. Practiced sorting with `ORDER BY` to retrieve organized data.

- **Joins:** Demonstrated the ability to perform joins, including an `INNER JOIN` between the `cartoons` and `horror` tables and a `LEFT JOIN` for unmatched records.

- **Comments:** Incorporated descriptive comments to provide insights into each query's purpose and functionality.

## Knowledge and Insights Gained

- **Practical Learning:** By executing the script, I gained hands-on experience with essential SQL operations, learning to create databases, populate tables, retrieve and filter data, and perform joins for data analysis.

- **Understanding Data Management:** Through this project, I sharpened my ability to manage data effectively, an essential skill for roles involving data analysis, database management, and backend development.

## Notable Insights

This project allowed me to build a strong foundation in using MySQL Workbench, demonstrating my ability to work with databases, execute SQL queries, and analyze data.

## Getting Started

- **Prerequisites:** Ensure you have MySQL Workbench installed and ready to use.

- **Engage:** Open MySQL Workbench and create a new query tab.

- **Execute Queries:** Copy and paste the provided SQL script into the query tab. Execute the script.
